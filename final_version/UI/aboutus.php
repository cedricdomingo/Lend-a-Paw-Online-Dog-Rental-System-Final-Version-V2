		 <h1>About Us</h1>
		 <p>Fortunately, Lend A Paw provides a solution to this problem by bridging the gap between dog owners who must spend time away from home,
		 and the millions of children, adults, and elderly citizens who would benefit from spending quality time with a dog, 
		 without the requirement of buying and owning a dog.
